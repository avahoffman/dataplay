#' The Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED), the data source for this report, is
#' an annual census of individuals who earn research doctoral degrees from
#' accredited U.S. academic institutions. The survey is sponsored by the
#' National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) within the
#' National Science Foundation and by three other federal agencies: the
#' National Institutes of Health, the Department of Education, and the National
#' Endowment for the Humanities.
#'
#' Monitoring the number of degrees awarded in science and engineering fields
#' is an important part of the mission of NCSES, the nationâ€™s leading provider
#' of statistical data on the U.S. science and engineering enterprise.
#'
#' The annual report calls attention to major trends in doctoral education and
#' is organized into four recurring themes and a special focus area that
#' highlight important questions about doctorate recipients. The report can be
#' viewed at [https://ncses.nsf.gov/sed/](https://ncses.nsf.gov/sed/).
