SOURCE: National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics, Survey of
Earned Doctorates.

The Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED), the data source for this report, is
an annual census of individuals who earn research doctoral degrees from
accredited U.S. academic institutions. The survey is sponsored by the
National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) within the
National Science Foundation and by three other federal agencies: the
National Institutes of Health, the Department of Education, and the National
Endowment for the Humanities.

Monitoring the number of degrees awarded in science and engineering fields
is an important part of the mission of NCSES, the nationâ€™s leading provider
of statistical data on the U.S. science and engineering enterprise.

The annual report calls attention to major trends in doctoral education and
is organized into four recurring themes and a special focus area that
highlight important questions about doctorate recipients. The report can be
viewed at \url{https://ncses.nsf.gov/sed/}.
